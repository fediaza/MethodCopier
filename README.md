# 📦 Copy Deep – Visual Studio Extension

**Copy Deep** is a Visual Studio extension that helps you extract a method along with all its dependencies — including private submethods, fields, and required types — into a self-contained class.

> ⚙️ Ideal for **legacy code migration**, **modularization**, and **refactoring**.

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Copy any method from your code
- ✅ Automatically includes:
  - Private submethods
  - Referenced fields
  - Required nested types
- ✅ Generates a clean, standalone class with preserved behavior
- ✅ Integrates into the **Edit > Copy** menu as **"Copy Deep"**
